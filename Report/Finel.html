    <p> An inspection of the exterior elevated elements (&ldquo;EEE&rdquo;) listed in Annex 1, their load-bearing components (&ldquo;LBC&rdquo;), and associated waterproofing elements (&ldquo;AWE&rdquo;) located at: <strong>______________________{Address}_____________________</strong>, ______________, _____________ (&ldquo;Site&rdquo;) was conducted by the undersigned (&ldquo;Inspector&rdquo;) on: _____Name of user creating the final report _________________________________________________________________________________________ pursuant to the requirements of California <strong>[Civil Code Section 5551 (if done for an HOA) or Health and Safety Code Section 17973 (if done for an apartment)] </strong>and under the terms of a contract between the Site owner and _Keep Blank_______________________________, and Deck Inspectors (&ldquo;Company&rdquo;).&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Generally speaking, the Exterior Elevated Elements at the Site consist of (check all applicable):</p>
    <p>Keep Designer mode check boxes for user ease</p>
    <p>☐ decks ☐ porches ☐ stairways ☐ walkways ☐ entry structures </p>
    <p>☐ other (specify)___________________________________________________________________</p>
    <p>The associated waterproofing elements for the foregoing generally consist of (check all applicable):</p>
    <p>Keep Designer mode check boxes for user ease</p>
    <p>☐ flashings ☐ membranes ☐ coatings ☐ sealants</p>
    <p>☐ other (specify)___________________________________________________________________</p>
    <p>Units or areas specifically excluded from this Report of Inspection (If any), are:</p>
    <p>_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________</p>
    <p>Reason for exclusion: _______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________</p>
    <p>Following Annex 1 are photographs of the inspected elements keyed to the item number of the element shown on the Annex. If more than one photograph relates to a single element, then those photographs are keyed to the item number of the element and then internally serially numbered, viz., if three photographs of element No. 7 were taken, those photographs are identified with the unit or location #</p>
    <p>Annex 1 indicates the location of the elements, their current condition and their expectations for future performance/expected service life. Expected service life of the elements and components is estimated based upon the required inspection of the existing elements or components (including any damage which may be present), current standards for building design and construction, and the reasonable assumption that the elements and components will receive proper routine maintenance henceforward. In cases involving elements that have a poor condition or 4 years or less of projected service life, it is recommended that such elements [(for apartments) be subject to further inspection (or for HOAs) be repaired or replaced<strong>] </strong>within one year of date. The undersigned considers that elements noted as being in very poor condition or having a projected service life of under one year <strong>pose an immediate threat to the health and safety of the occupants</strong>: Element posing threats (If any)</p>
    <p>___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________</p>
    <p><strong>If any elements noted above are not repaired pursuant to statue noted above, the owner must restrict all access to those elements and conduct emergency repairs thereto, including shoring if necessary, until all repairs are made and inspected. </strong></p>
